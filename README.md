# home-site
This is my home website!
This was created with React.js, and has a couple of features:

```
1. Links to commonly used pages
2. Automatically updating date
3. Weather API integration
4. Changing icons based on weather
```

(still waiting on domain + server)

Side graphics are borrowed from GMK Colorchrome's Stencil deskmat.
